Thempe (/tempe/) is an acronym of Thematic Mapping Practice and Explanation.
Inspired by Tempeh, a Javanese food which is written in Javanese as: ꦠꦺꦩ꧀ꦥꦺ (Tempeh in Wikipedia).
By learning map types in Thempe you will gain more knowledge in the simplest and exciting way.

There are four main contents in Thempe:
1. Introduction to Thematic Mapping
(Introduction - Good Thematic Map Examples)
2. Cartographic Process
(Data - Perception Properties - Visual Variables)
3. Map Types
(Choropleth Map - Proportional Symbol Map - Flow Map)
4. Map Elements
(Map Frame - Map Title - Map Legend - Map Scale - Orientation - Map Citation)

Thempe is completely an Open Educational Resource.
You can add more materials on Thempe. I would be glad if someone wants to discuss it with me too.
